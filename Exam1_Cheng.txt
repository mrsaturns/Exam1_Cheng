1. Yes. Bioinformatics is a very broad field with many subfields. It involves using tools to generate and analyze biological data to then better understand living systems. Ecological modeling of populations of organisms certainly involves biological data and we can use tools to better understand them. There are actually many groups studying these and related topics using bioinformatics tools. 

2. False

3. We can conclude that this match is homologous with our query with high confidence because the E value is less than 1E-50

4. PCR or cloning

5. Two or three genomes in eukaryotic cells; one for prokaryotic cells

	1. https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/metapopulation-research-centre
	2. LiSs (Linkage map superscaffolder)
	3. Lep-MAP- constructs linkage maps using high-density SNP data, MIP Scaffolder- genome scaffolding, Coral and HybridSHREC- read error correction, PANNZER- functional annotation, EPT and SANS for orthology prediction
	4. Yes, we can search for the project keywords in BioProject and find the group (University of Helsinki) and their projects. 
	5. Our task is to detect de novo SNPs, not included by SNP arrays. We can achieve that by looking at next generation sequencing (especially whole genome sequencing) and aligning publicly available sequences to the reference genomes assembled by the above group (University  of Helsinki)
